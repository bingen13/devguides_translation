While many pull request discussion centered around implementation, there were several that needed to be edited to make the new code compliant with NVDA's coding guidelines."""),
"",_(u"""In 2019, as part of a broader effort to port NVDA to Python 3 and to ease pull request review process, NV Access introduced linting tools, specifically Flake8. Linting allows source code to be checked for coding guidelines and bives a chance for contributors to correct mistakes before submitting changes for review by the community."""),
