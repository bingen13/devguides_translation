_(u"""	- The add-on repo must contain a branch named stable, where authors or other people with write access to the repo should merge code considered stable when the add-on is updated. This branch is used to send translatable messages to, and receive l10n updates from, the [NVDA translation repo](http://subversion.assembla.com/svn/screenReaderTranslations)."""),
