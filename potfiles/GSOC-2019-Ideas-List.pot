msgid "Partly due to the amount of information NVDA must fetch, and partly due to recent slowdowns in the object model itself, NVDA's access for Microsoft Excel is becoming slower, and in some cases  totally impractical. Although NV Access is working closely with the Excel team at Microsoft to rectify the recent slowdowns, we should definitely consider actions we can take in NVDA to limit or batch object model calls in order to provide the best performance."
