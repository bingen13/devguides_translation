msgid "This document provides rough guidelines for the process of developing NVDA releases. All current and potential developers and translators should read and follow this document. These guidelines may be broken under special circumstances. Any concerns should be discussed with the lead developers: Mick Curran (@michaelDCurran) and Reef Turner (@feerrenrut)."

msgid "### Goals and reasoning"
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\ReleaseProcess.py:8
msgid "The main goal of these changes is to remove the need for a \"next\" branch and pull request incubation. Reasons for this are:"
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\ReleaseProcess.py:9
msgid "* The next branch required manual merging of pull requests. This did not fit in well with Github's infrastructure in that these incubation merges were not tracked very well, reverts were messy and sometimes required next to be totally re-created, pull requests on next would frequently become conflicted with other pull requests, which meant manually fixing conflicts in both next and master."
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\ReleaseProcess.py:10
msgid " * Up until recently incubation was the only way we could guarantee some kind of code quality. Now we have a growing number of unit tests, system testing is well under way, and Github's management of pull requests (including mandatory code reviews) ensure a minimum code quality we did not have before."

msgid "### Changes for developers"
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\ReleaseProcess.py:12
msgid "* Once a pull request is approved by reviewers and all build checks pass, the pull request will be merged straight to master. There is no longer incubation on next."
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\ReleaseProcess.py:13
msgid "* If a merged pull request results in a regression, new bug or does not work as advertised, the lead developers will be a little more strict on reverting the pull request than in the past."

msgid "### Changes for testers"
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\ReleaseProcess.py:15
msgid "* The next branch and next snapshots will no longer exist. Anyone currently on a next snapshot will be automatically updated to new \"alpha\" snapshots. Alpha snapshots are created directly from Master each time it changes (I.e. when a pull request is merged).  As the name suggests, these snapshots are alpha quality. And although automated tests pass, these builds have had no user testing."
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\ReleaseProcess.py:16
msgid " * Anyone currently on master snapshots will be upgraded to the first available tagged beta for the current release. Beta builds, as the name implies, are beta quality and have had some testing by users. Note that as new betas are made available you will keep automatically upgrading, and then also upgrade to the final stable release. To get back to beta testing for the next release you will need to manually download a new beta for that release."

#: ..\python_docs\ReleaseProcess.py:28
msgid "* Once a pull request has been reviewed and approved by at least one NVDA Collaborator and all build checks have passed, a lead developer will make a final commit to the pull request which updates changes.t2t, and then will squash merge the pull request into master."
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\ReleaseProcess.py:29
msgid "* If the merging of a pull request to master causes any build checks on master to fail, the pull request is reverted without question. This is however unlikely to be an issue as build checks on the pull request itself must have already passed."

msgid "* Up until 7 weeks before a release, a last known good commit of master (I.e. one that passes build checks) will be periodically merged into a \"beta\" branch, making that code available for early translation. The beta branch at this stage should still be considered bleeding-edge, and is not recommended for people than other to check early translation work."

New pull requests may be now considered for squash merging straight to beta, if and only if they are addressing a bug introduced in the current release cycle or a critical Operating System change out of our control.

msgid "* If any changes are made to beta, such as the merging of critical pull requests or translation merges, beta will be periodically merged back to master. "

#: ..\python_docs\ReleaseProcess.py:38
msgid "* Starting from 5 weeks before final release, tagged beta releases will be published periodically, allowing the wider community to try out the betas. At this stage code originally introduced through master will have been tested for at least 2 weeks, thus the beta builds can be seen as beta quality."

#: ..\python_docs\ReleaseProcess.py:39
