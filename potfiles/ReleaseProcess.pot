msgid "This document provides rough guidelines for the process of developing NVDA releases. All current and potential developers and translators should read and follow this document. These guidelines may be broken under special circumstances. Any concerns should be discussed with the lead developers: Mick Curran (@michaelDCurran) and Reef Turner (@feerrenrut)."

msgid "### Goals and reasoning"
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\ReleaseProcess.py:8
msgid "The main goal of these changes is to remove the need for a \"next\" branch and pr incubation. Reasons for this are:"
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\ReleaseProcess.py:9
msgid "* The next branch required manual merging of prs. This did not fit in well with Github's infrastructure in that these incubation merges were not tracked very well, reverts were messy and sometimes required next to be totally re-created, prs on next would frequently become conflicted with other prs, which meant manually fixing conflicts in both next and master."
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\ReleaseProcess.py:10
msgid " * Up until recently incubation was the only way we could guarantee some kind of code quality. Now we have a growing number of unit tests, system testing is well under way, and Github's management of prs (including mandatory code reviews) ensure a minimum code quality we did not have before."

msgid "### Changes for developers"
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\ReleaseProcess.py:12
msgid "* Once a pr is approved by reviewers and all build checks pass, the pr will be merged straight to master. There is no longer incubation on next."
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\ReleaseProcess.py:13
msgid "* If a merged pr results in a regression, new bug or does not work as advertised, the lead developers will be a little more strict on reverting the pr than in the past."

msgid "### Changes for testers"
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\ReleaseProcess.py:15
msgid "* The next branch and next snapshots will no longer exist. Anyone currently on a next snapshot will be automatically updated to master snapshots."
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\ReleaseProcess.py:16
msgid " * Anyone currently on master snapshots will stay on master snapshots, however it is important to note that these snapshots should now be considered less stable than they were previously as code is no longer incubated first. Having said this though, as we have also now put in place automated checks testing the code, we should be able to guarantee these snapshots will always run. We do advise though if you would prefer something a little more stable, to consider testing our new beta releases, that will start coming out about 5 weeks before the official release."

msgid "* \"master\" is the mainline branch for NVDA development. Once a pull request has been reviewed and approved by at least one lead developer and all build checks have passed, it will be squash merged into master."
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\ReleaseProcess.py:24
msgid "* If the merging of a pr to master causes any build checks on master to fail, the pr is reverted without question. This is however unlikely to be an issue as build checks on the PR itself must have already passed."
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\ReleaseProcess.py:25
msgid "* If a merged pr has been identified as causing a regression, new bug, or does not work as originally reported, the pr may be reverted at the discretion of the lead developers. Reasons in favor of not reverting the pr may be: "

msgid "* Compiled snapshots of master will be made available to the public for very early testing. This is bleeding-edge code and should never be run in production environments."

msgid "* Up until 7 weeks before a release, a last known good commit of master (I.e. one that passes build checks) will be periodically merged into a \"beta\" branch, making that code available for early translation. The beta branch at this stage should still be considered bleeding-edge, and is not recommended for people than other to check early translation work."

msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\ReleaseProcess.py:31
msgid "* From 7 weeks before the release, merges from master to beta will no longer occur. New pull requests may be now considered for squash merging straight to beta, if and only if they are addressing a bug introduced in the current release cycle or a critical Operating System change out of our control. "

#: ..\python_docs\ReleaseProcess.py:32
msgid "* If any changes are made to beta, such as the merging of critical prs or translation merges, beta will be periodically merged back to master. "
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\ReleaseProcess.py:33
msgid "* Starting from 5 weeks before final release, tagged beta releases will be published periodically, allowing the wider community to try out the betas. At this stage code originally introduced through master will have been tested for at least 2 weeks, thus the beta builds can be seen as beta quality."

#: ..\python_docs\ReleaseProcess.py:34

Minor spelling or grammatical fixes may be made to documentation files, but gettext strings in the code should not be changed at all."
