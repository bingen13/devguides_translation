msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\nvdaPy3.py:6
msgid "Python is one of the popular programming languages for various projects. Its ease of learning, extensive standard library modules and third-party extensions, as well as extensive documentation and clear syntax makes it an ideal choice for scripting."

#: ..\python_docs\nvdaPy3.py:7
msgid "Currently there are two major branches of Python: 2.x, released in early 2000's, and 3.x, first released in 2008. At first glance, Python 3 may seem similar to Python 2, but there are numerous deeper differences, including extensive Unicode support in Python 3, module renames and so on."

msgid "## Rationale"
msgstr ""

#: ..\python_docs\nvdaPy3.py:9
msgid "When NVDA began in 2006, it used python 2.4. Over the years, NvDA and its add-ons were written in Python 2.7. By moving to Python 3, NVDA project seeks to provide improvements in Unicode support, improved performance in various operations and other benefits, which goes beyond just the screen reader."
