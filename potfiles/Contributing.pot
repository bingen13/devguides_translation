However, this should be fairly rare. If in doubt, use an issue first."

msgid "When you fork the repository, GitHub will create a copy of the master branch. However, this branch will not be updated when the official master branch is updated. To ensure your work is always based on the latest commit in the official master branch, it is recommended that your master branch be linked to the official master branch, rather than the master branch in your GitHub fork. If you have cloned your GitHub fork, you can do this from the command line as follows:"
