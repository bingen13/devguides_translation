#: ..\python_docs\nvdaPy3.py:6

"Python is one of the popular programming languages for various projects. Its "

"Currently there are two major branches of Python: 2.x, released in early "
"2000's, and 3.x, first released in 2008. At first glance, Python 3 may seem "

"extensive Unicode support in Python 3, module renames and so on."

"When NVDA began in 2006, it used python 2.4. Over the years, NvDA and its "

"various operations and other benefits, which goes beyond just the screen "
